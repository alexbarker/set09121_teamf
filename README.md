# Description

Picobots is a mini-machine versus biology, dungeon crawler game from the top-down perspective. The name is based on the scale of measurement, a pico (1x10^-12), which is just below the nanoscale. As a small robot, the player will have to navigate seven levels, filled with enemies and obstacles before facing off against the boss level. Some enemies will track the player down, some will follow a strict path and some will fire bullets, all of which the player must avoid or the level will restart. This is a single-player-versus-the-game type.
